# Load Packages

Let's load the packages we need. These include `tidyverse` (especially the `dplyr` package) and `janitor`. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

# clean_names

```{r}
bad_names <- read_csv("data/badnames.csv")

bad_names

```

With the `bad_names` data frame, we have to use back tick (`) before and after variable names with spaces in them. Also, RStudio doesn't autocomplete the variable names, which is a pain!

```{r}

bad_names %>% 
  skim(`Age Decade`)

```

We can use `clean_names` as follows:

```{r}

good_names <- bad_names %>% 
  clean_names()


good_names

```

Variable names are much easier to type now! And RStudio autocompletes them, which is super handy.

```{r}

good_names %>% 
  skim(age_decade)

```


# Import NHANES Data

Let's import our data using `read_csv`. Note that the NHANES data is in the data directory so we need to include that.

```{r}
nhanes <- read_csv("data/nhanes.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
```

Let's see what our data looks like.

```{r}
nhanes
```



# select

![](slides/images/select.png)

With `select` we can select variables from the larger data frame.

```{r}
nhanes %>%
  select(age)
```


We can also use `select` for multiple variables:

```{r}
nhanes %>%
  select(height, weight)
```


We can use `one_of()` to do the same thing:

```{r}
nhanes %>%
  select(one_of(c("height", "weight")))
```

Used within `select`, the `contains` function selects variable with certain text in the variable name:


```{r}
nhanes %>%
  select(contains("age"))
```


We can `select` a range of columns using the var1:var2 pattern


```{r}
nhanes %>%
  select(weight:bmi)
```



We can drop variables using the -var format:


```{r}
nhanes %>%
  select(-id)
```



We can drop a set of variables using the -(var1:var2) format:


```{r}
nhanes %>%
  select(-(id:education))
```

# mutate

![](slides/images/mutate.png)

We use `mutate` we make new variables or change existing ones. 

We can use `mutate` in three ways:

Create a **new variable with a specific value**

```{r}
nhanes %>%
  mutate(country = "United States") %>% 
  select(id:education, country)
```


Create a **new variable based on other variables**

```{r}
nhanes %>%
  mutate(height_inches = height / 2.54) %>% 
  select(contains("height"))
```

Change an **existing variable**

```{r}
nhanes %>%
  mutate(bmi = round(bmi, digits = 1)) %>% 
  select(bmi)
```



# A Brief Interlude

## Comparisons

```{r echo = FALSE}

tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator, ~Description, ~Usage,
  "<", "less than", "x < y",
  "<=", "less than or equal to", "x <= y",
  ">", "greater than", "x > y",
  ">=", "greater than or equal to", "x >= y",
  "==", "exactly equal to", "x == y",
  "!=", "not equal to", "x != y",
  "%in%", "group membership", "x %in% y",
  "is.na", "is missing", "is.na(x)",
  "!is.na", "is not missing", "!is.na(x)"
)
```


## Logical operators

With logical operators, we can create complex filters (e.g. keep only those who say their health is "good", "very good", or "excellent").

```{r echo = FALSE}

tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator, ~Description, ~Usage,
  "&", "and", "x & y",
  "|", "or", "x | y",
  # "xor", "exactly x or y", "xor(x, y)",
  "!", "not", "!x"
)

```


# filter

![](slides/images/filter.png)

We use `filter` to choose a subset of cases.

We use `==` to select all cases that meet the criteria.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>%
  select(gender)
```

We use `!=` to select all cases that don't meet the criteria.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(health_gen != "Good") %>%
  select(health_gen)
```



We can combine comparisons and logical operators.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(health_gen != "Good" | health_gen != "VGood" | health_gen != "Excellent") %>%
  select(health_gen)
```


We can use `%in%` to collapse multiple comparisons into one.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(health_gen %in% c("Good", "VGood", "Excellent")) %>%
  select(health_gen)
```

We can chain together multiple `filter` functions. Doing it this way, we don't have create complex logic in one line.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "male") %>%
  filter(health_gen %in% c("Good", "VGood", "Excellent")) %>%
  select(gender, health_gen)
```

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "male" & (health_gen == "Good" | health_gen == "VGood" | health_gen == "Excellent")) %>%
  select(gender, health_gen)
```


We can use Use `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `=>` for numeric data.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(age > 50)
```


We can drop `NAs` with `!is.na` 

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(age > 50) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(marital_status)) %>%
  select(age, marital_status)
```


You can also drop `NAs` with `drop_na`

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(age > 50) %>% 
  drop_na(marital_status) %>%
  select(age, marital_status)
```



# summarize

![](slides/images/summarize.png)


With `summarize`, we can go from a complete dataset down to a summary.

We use these functions with `summarize`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~Description, ~Usage,
  "number", "n()",
  "sum", "sum(x)",
  "minimum", "min(x)",
  "maximum", "max(x)",
  "mean", "mean(x)",
  "median", "mean(x)",
  "standard deviation", "sd(x)",
  "variance", "var(x)",
  "rank", "rank(x)"
)
```

This doesn't work! Notice what the result is.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days))
```

We need to add `na.rm = TRUE` to tell R to drop `NA` values.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days,
                                    na.rm = TRUE))
```


We can have multiple arguments in each usage of `summarize`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_active_days = median(phys_active_days, na.rm = TRUE),
            number_of_responses = n())
```




# group_by

![](slides/images/group-by.png)


`summarize` becomes truly powerful when paired with `group_by`, which enables us to perform calculations on each group. 


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  group_by(age_decade) %>%
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days,
                                    na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

We can use `group_by` with multiple groups.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  group_by(age_decade, gender) %>%
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days,
                                    na.rm = TRUE)) 
```




## count

If we just want to count the number of things per group, we can use `count`.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  count(age_decade)
```



We can also count by multiple groups.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  count(age_decade, gender)
```





# arrange

![](slides/images/arrange.png)

With `arrange`, we can reorder rows in a data frame based on the values of one or more variables. R arranges in ascending order by default.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  arrange(age)
```

We can also arrange in descending order using `desc()`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  arrange(desc(age))
```

We often use `arrange` at the end of chains to display things in order.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  group_by(age_decade, gender) %>%
  summarize(mean_active_days = mean(phys_active_days,
                                    na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_active_days) 
```


# Create new data frames

Sometimes you want to save the results of your work to a new data frame. 

```{r}
female_height_inches_by_age <- nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>% 
  mutate(height_inches = height / 2.54) %>% 
  group_by(age_decade) %>% 
  summarize(height_inches = mean(height_inches,
                                    na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

```{r}
female_height_inches_by_age
```



# Crosstabs

Sometimes you want your results in a crosstab. We can use the `tabyl` function in `janitor` package to make crosstabs automatically.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_decade) 
```


`janitor` has a set of functions that all start with `adorn_` that add a number of things to our crosstabs. We call them after `tabyl`. For example, `adorn_totals`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_decade) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col"))
```


We can add `adorn_percentages` to add percentages.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_decade) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages()
```



We can then format these percentages using `adorn_pct_formatting`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_decade) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() 
```



If we want to include the n alongside percentages, we can use `adorn_ns`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_decade) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns()
```



We can add titles to our crosstabs using `adorn_title`. 

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_decade) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns() %>% 
  adorn_title()
```




We can also do three (or more) way crosstabs automatically by adding more variables to the `tabyl` function.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(gender, age_decade, education) %>%
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns() %>% 
  adorn_title(placement = "combined")

```
